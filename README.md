# Snappy RecyclerView

A simple implementation of a RecyclerView which makes use of the [SnapHelper](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/SnapHelper.html) class to make the RecyclerView snap the nearest item.

Also uses the distance from the center to fade out and scale each item on scroll.

## Uses
 - Android Data Binding

## Limitations
 - Currently only works in portrait
 
## Future Work
 - Add a `snappedToItem` listener
